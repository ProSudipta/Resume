## Introduction
In this assignment, we embarked on a journey of data analysis and machine learning using the well-known Iris dataset. The objective was to explore the dataset, build machine learning models, and evaluate their performance in classifying the iris species based on features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Data Exploration
We began by loading the dataset and performing initial exploratory data analysis:
- Checked basic statistics and summarized key dataset characteristics.
- Visualized the data through histograms and pair plots to gain insights into feature distributions and relationships.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps included:
- Checked for missing values (none were found).
- Dropped the 'Id' column, as it was deemed unnecessary.

## Feature Engineering
In this assignment, we opted not to engage in feature engineering as the dataset's original features already provided valuable information for our classification task.

## Data Splitting
To assess the performance of our machine learning models, we thoughtfully divided the dataset into training and testing sets, with 70% of the data allocated for training and 30% for testing.

## Machine Learning Model
In our quest for classification accuracy, we employed three distinctive machine learning models:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees

## Model Training and Evaluation
Our models underwent rigorous training and evaluation:
- Logistic Regression Accuracy:  93.33333333333333%
- K-Nearest Neighbors Accuracy:  95.55555555555556%
- Decision Trees Accuracy:  97.43333333333333%
  
Our evaluation process extended beyond accuracy, as we generated classification reports that provided insights into the precision, recall, and F1-score for each iris species.

## Visualization
Visualizations played a pivotal role in our analysis:
- We created a heatmap to illustrate the correlation matrix, helping us identify relationships between features.
- Scatter plots showcased the relationships between sepal and petal dimensions by species.
- A heatmap showing correlations between features.
